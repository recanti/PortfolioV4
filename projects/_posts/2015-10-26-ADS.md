The Administrative Data System (ADS) is a PHP web application that was developed for RITâ€™s College of Computing and Information Sciences. I, and a team of 2 other people, came on to the project during the second phase of development. At that point, most of the major features had been implemented. Our goal was to maintain the system and add new features when needed. 

## Day-to-Day
This project involved a lot work in both the front-end and the back-end. AJAX played a large role in the application and a large part of the job was setting up forms so that their data could be easily be parsed, serialized, and processed via jQuery.

When interacting with the back-end, we needed to be able to retrieve information from the database, as well as add information to it. We used MeekroDB to connect to the database and execute custom SQL queries. 

Another part of the job was rewriting pages to follow a consistent style. We rewrote the HTML for these pages so that they could be styled using a common CSS file.

## Things worked on

One thing of the big features I implemented was a modular filter system. Most sections used a table system for displaying different entries that could be searched through using a search field or by narrowing it down by letter. Each of these options worked well on their own, but didn't work well when we tried to add additional filter options. To solve this, I created a standard filter object.

The filter object was a holder for different filter components. The user would add compenents to the object with set parameters. After they are all added, the user just calls a render function to draw it all on the screen. In addition to a generic radio and checkbox filters, I also ported over the search field and the letter search. Functionally they were the same, but under the hood they were stylistically more consistent with other elements and they scaled better when additional fields were added.
