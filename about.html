	<p>I'm front-end developer who is also skilled in design and back-end development. From simple static sites to complex web applications, I can get the job done!</p>

	<p>I've always liked making new things and sharing them with others. The web makes both of these things easy, which is why I love working on it so much. It's probably also why I spend so much time there! There's lot's of ways to contact me online. Feel free to get in touch!</p>
